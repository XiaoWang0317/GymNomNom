## Inspected Bugs and Issues

This section outlines some of the current bugs and issues identified in our system. Our team is actively working to resolve these to improve user experience.

### 1. Backend Exception Handling on the Frontend

- **Issue**: The mechanism for handling backend exceptions on the frontend interface is not functioning optimally. This may lead to unclear error messages or a lack of feedback when an error occurs.
- **Impact**: Users may experience confusion or difficulty understanding why certain actions are not being processed correctly.
- **Status**: Under investigation for improvements. We aim to implement more descriptive and user-friendly error messages.

### 2. Ineffective Results with Extreme Nutritional Intake Values

- **Issue**: When users input extreme values for their nutritional intake, the food recommendation algorithm may produce less effective or unrealistic suggestions.
- **Impact**: This can lead to suboptimal dietary advice, potentially affecting the users' nutritional balance and fitness goals.
- **Proposed Solution**: Introducing input validation to flag extreme values and prompting users to re-enter more realistic data. We are also considering refining our recommendation algorithm to handle a wider range of input more effectively.

### 3. Inability to Change Username, Password, or Fitness Type

- **Issue**: Currently, users do not have the option to change their username, password, or selected fitness goal after account creation.
- **Impact**: This limitation restricts users' flexibility and control over their account settings, which may be necessary as their goals or preferences change.
- **Proposed Solution**: We are planning to introduce a feature in the user profile settings allowing users to update their username, password, and fitness goal. This feature will enhance user autonomy and improve overall satisfaction with the platform.

We are committed to continuously improving our platform and value user feedback in identifying and resolving these issues.
